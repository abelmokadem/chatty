# Chatty Style Guide
Style guide built using [fractal](http://fractal.build/). Runs [csscomb](http://csscomb.com/) as a precommit hook to 
keep the SCSS tidy. The structure is based on 
[ITCSS](https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture/) and uses BEM as a naming convention. 

## Getting started

Run the following commands:
``` bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the style guide.

## Scripts
- `start`: Run development server at `http://localhost:3000`
- `build`: Build and output css to `public/css/styles.css`
- `precommit` Tidy up the code before committing
